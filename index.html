        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Rishi Manimaran and I am third year CS major from McLean,
          Virginia. I've always found great fulfillment in helping my community,
          and my experience as a branch manager for the GIVE tutoring program
          was especially rewarding. Working directly with underserved children,
          I saw firsthand the positive impact education can have on young lives.
          Now, I'm excited about the prospect of combining my passion for
          software development with my desire to help others. I envision a
          career where I can use my programming skills to create innovative
          solutions that address social issues, improve access to education, or
          streamline nonprofit operations. By merging technology with social
          impact, I hope to scale my ability to make a difference and contribute
          to meaningful projects that positively affect communities on a broader
          scale.
